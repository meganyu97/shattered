being with you takes me out of time
clocks cease to exist and the only metronome
is the beating of your heart in my ear
the only amount of time I can tell when i'm with you is forever
it's the closest feeling to immortality as i'll get. 
all this time i've been looking at life through a broken shard of glass
you gave me a kaleidoscope
and turned my broken shards into a mosaic.
